## About
This page presents my current teaching experience both as a graduate teaching assistant (TA) and as an instructor at Arizona State University (ASU). It includes the title of the course and a brief description of activities<br><br>


## Instructor
**FSE100: Introduction to Engineering**<br>
Instructed 40 student Introduction to Engineering course and advised both a graduate and undergraduate teaching assistant. Delivered lectures covering the engineering design process, circuits, Arduino, TinkerCAD, Matlab, and design. Facilitated final student deign project covering the topic of 'Mission to Mars' by fostering creativty and safety. Assited students with Arduino code, circuits, build design, and tool usage. To view the students final project demonstrations, please check out this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3sZVTvZ65WY1cMXEj3gapqPcAhk5zHe6). In order to facilitate student projects, an [example prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTCpvEL5bzs&ab_channel=JacobSindorf) was also created for the course. <br><br>

## Teaching Assistant
**EGR304: Embedded Systems Design Project I**<br>
Reviewed and debugged student circuit projects and PCB designs. Assisted students in microcontroller programming through PSoC creator and advised students with KiCAD and Cadence.<br><br>
**EGR202: Use Inspired Design II**<br>
Held weekly supplemental instruction sessions and created quiz questions.<br><br>
**EGR202: Use Inspired Design II**<br>
Aided in the overall course development and structure and graded assignments. Course development was centered around electronic skateboards, and how students can reverse engineer them by examining the motor and electronic components. <br><br>
**EGR201: Use Inspired Design**<br>
Drafted course material including lectures, homeworks, and reading guides. Assisted students with CAD drawings and 3D printing.<br><br>
**EGR280: Engineering Statistics** <br> 
Hosted open office hours and recorded supplemnetal review sessions for each exam. <br><br>
