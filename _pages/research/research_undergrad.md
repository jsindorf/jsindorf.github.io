## <center> Undergraduate Research</center>
### Undergraduate Research Interests
My undergraduate research consisted of two main projects:<br> 
[Statisitcal Analysis of Brain Regions to Identify MCI](/undergradlab/). My research lab work at UofA. <br>
[Laser Cell Micropatterning Controller](/sure_page/). My REU at Clemson (SURE program). <br>

### Publications
