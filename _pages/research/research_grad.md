### Dissertation
Title: *Exploration of the Photoplethysmography Signal and its Application to Wearable Devices* <br>
Successfully defended April 2023.<br>
(An online pdf of the dissertation document can be found [here](https://keep.lib.asu.edu/system/files/c7/Sindorf_asu_0010E_22685.pdf))

### Graduate Research Interests
My graduate research interests revolved around wearable devices and robotics. Specifically, the use and dynamics behind the photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is a simple optical sensor that measures changes in blood volume levels commonly used to interpret heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Throughout my graduate degree I have focused on using embedded machine learning, dynamical discovery, and more to develop improved heart rate detection systems while also better understanding the bio-signal. <br> 

Three projects serve as the basis for my graduate research. <br>
- The first is a continuation of a graduate project on [Embedded Heart Rate Estimation](/bmi598_page/). Some major changes have been made to the project including the use of Edge Impulse and the addition of initial subject testing. This project focuses on Python, Arduino, Machine Learning, and wearable devices. A second algorithm using a sliding window and MATLAB was also implemented for comparison to the embedded ML method. (This work was presented at SKM, see below)
- The second is a continuation of a graduate project on [Data Driven Dynamic Discovery of the PPG](/egr608_page/). More work has been done exploring other nonlinear systems and fine tuning the SINDy algorithm. 
- Laslty, is the project [PBVI for Motion Artifact and Sensor System Energy Savings](/eee598lb_page/). A practical application for the project is being researched. To do this, an end to end embedded activity detection system with machine learning was made. Also, two filters were created to reduce and limit the effect of motion artifact on PPG signals. (see publication below)
