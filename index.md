## Website Goal
The goal of this website is to create an interactive and visual way to view parts of my academic and professional career. It highlights projects and skills I learned during my journey that may otherwise be left in the past, including things from course projects, internships, and previous jobs. This website is a living document that will be forever growing, just like me. <br><br>
Click through the links provided at the top of the page to explore my graduate research, teaching experience and some graduate and undergraduate projects. 
<br><br>
My resume and CV can be found at the bottom of this page. 

## About Me
My name is Jacob Sindorf, and I am a currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. A true Arizona native now in the windy city, I have lived my entire life in the Grand Canyon state, from my first steps until my dissertation.<br>
After high school I found myself yearning to move as far away from home as possible. Ambitious and determined, I landed a daunting 150 miles away, in Tucson, Arizona. The sunny skies and dusty roads of Tucson presented a major fork in my career: engineering or medical school. Confident, I already knew my decision and went straight down the middle of both of them with biomedical engineering. Four years pass, and the opportunity to further my education finally gave me a way to move even farther from home. This time a full 50 miles to be exact. <br>
The final semester at UofA was cut short due to COVID, and my first year at ASU was almost entirely through a computer screen. Adversity, however, always provides a way to grow. I took the time to focus on becoming an independent scholar, an individual whose skill set makes them an irreplaceable member of any team. After a year hunched in front of a computer screen, I walked the home stretch of my PhD with a Masterâ€™s degree in hand. With 3 out of 3 degrees completed, I now spend my time adapting to the Midwest cold. <br> <br>
